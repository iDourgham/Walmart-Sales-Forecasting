Sales Forecasting for Walmart
====================================================================

This project focuses on a real-world time series forecasting challenge: predicting **weekly sales for a specific department within a Walmart dataset**. Utilizing historical sales data, the goal is to develop and evaluate a forecasting model that can accurately predict future weekly sales.

* * * * *

üìä Project Overview
-------------------

This repository contains the analysis and forecasting model for predicting weekly sales for **Department [YOUR_DEPARTMENT_ID]** from a cleaned Walmart dataset. The project follows a multi-step forecasting approach, aiming to provide robust predictions for future sales periods.

Key aspects of this project include:

-   **Target Variable:** Predicting `Weekly_Sales`.
-   **Data Filtering:** The analysis is strictly scoped to a single, assigned department, ensuring a focused and practical forecasting problem.
-   **Time Series Preparation:** Handling date and time features, and preparing the data for time series modeling.
-   **Multi-Step Forecasting:** Implementation of strategies (e.g., recursive single-step or direct multi-step) to predict sales for multiple future time periods.
-   **Model Development:** Building and evaluating a time series forecasting model tailored to the characteristics of the departmental sales data.

üöÄ Getting Started
------------------

To explore this project and run the analysis yourself, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Bash

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name

    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    Bash

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all the required libraries using pip. A `requirements.txt` file is usually included for this.

    Bash

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

    (If `requirements.txt` isn't provided, common libraries you might need include `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, and potentially `pmdarima` or `prophet` depending on the model chosen).

üìä Dataset
----------

This project utilizes a cleaned **Walmart sales dataset**. Each row represents weekly sales data, including:

-   **Date:** The week of the sales.
-   **Weekly_Sales:** The target variable to be predicted.
-   **Dept:** The department ID (this project focuses on a single, assigned department).
-   Other relevant features (e.g., `IsHoliday`, `Temperature`, `Fuel_Price`, `CPI`, `Unemployment` if used in the model).

*(If you used your own dataset, briefly describe it here: what it contains, its timestamp column, and target variable.)*

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
---------------------

-   **Python:** The core programming language.
-   **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and time series handling.
-   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
-   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
-   **Statsmodels / Scikit-learn / Prophet / pmdarima:**

üéØ Forecasting Approach
-----------------------

This project employs a **multi-step forecasting methodology**. Specifically, the notebook demonstrates:

-   *(**Option A: Recursive Single-Step** - if applicable)* Building a model that predicts one step ahead, then uses that prediction as an input to predict the next step, and so on.
-   *(**Option B: Direct Multi-Step** - if applicable)* Training separate models for each future time step, or a single model that directly outputs multiple future steps.

üìà Results & Evaluation
-----------------------

*(This section will be populated once you complete your project. It should include:)*

-   A summary of the model's performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE).
-   Visualizations of actual vs. predicted sales.
-   Discussion of any challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
